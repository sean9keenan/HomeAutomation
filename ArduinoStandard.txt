Defining the Arduino action device standard:

Goal: Bind Device.id.property to Arduino Stated

Arduino - Large device with certain pins, and a device identifier

Modules - Things like accelerometer, lights, switch
  compatible devices - Things like "Arduino", "Link Node"
    compatible pins, compatible sub versions (v3.0+), ect
  Operating pins - Requires 4 pins with "analog type", perhaps list all possible pin combinations under compatible pins for the device
  Accessor - Get the current state of this module (get lights status)
  Setters - Set the current state of this module (set lights on)






Arduino Sync Action:
Make Server Request, given it's IP address, we can reconize if it's the same area as the requesting device. If that fails we can ask them to input a serial number given to them. The device (Arduino ID) is then synced to that account
