        Link is a system that is in rapid development with really <strong>crappy links</strong>, based on the concept that <strong>eventually</strong> Sean might get around to fixing the <strong>link</strong>. If you're here then you should probably email Sean and tell him to stop being <strong>lazy</strong> and fix, you know, <strong>everything</strong>.

        <h2>Get It</h2>

        <p>You can... click the links above, or email below, it might help. Maybe.</p>

        <p><a class="btn" href="mailto:link404@skeenan.com">Email Sean &raquo;</a></p>

    <div class="span4">
        <h2>Register it</h2>

        <p>Once you own it then you'll get to see this error message even more! Because you'll be using the product more. If you want to stop seeing this message tell Sean how you got here.</p>
